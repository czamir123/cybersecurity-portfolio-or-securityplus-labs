# Week 10: Lab Environment Setup

In this folder, I document how I built a professional cybersecurity lab with:

- VMware ESXi server
- 3 real computers on my network
- pfSense firewall
- Segmented virtual networks

This environment will be used to run real labs like malware analysis, SIEM monitoring, IDS testing, and simulated phishing detection.

This shows my ability to:
✅ Set up secure infrastructure  
✅ Design internal networks  
✅ Use real-world job tools in a test-safe way
