# Week 10: Lab Environment Setup & Network Hardening

In this lab, I document how I built a professional-grade cybersecurity home lab using real computers and virtual machines. The goal is to simulate a secure enterprise network that can be used for malware analysis, penetration testing, monitoring, and Security+ certification labs.

## ðŸ’» Hardware Setup

- **VMware ESXi Server (on bare metal)**
  - Hosts all virtual machines and firewall instances
  - Accessed via VMware vSphere or Fusion

- **Computer 1 (Workstation)**
  - OS: Windows 10 Pro
  - Used for SIEM log monitoring, Splunk interface, and testing attacks

- **Computer 2 (Security Analyst Station)**
  - OS: Ubuntu Linux
  - Used to run tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Snort

- **Computer 3 (Simulated End User)**
  - OS: Windows 11 Home
  - Used for phishing test, endpoint behavior, and victim simulation

## ðŸ§± Network Setup

- **pfSense Firewall (VM)**
  - Segments the network into zones (internal, DMZ, WAN)
  - Provides firewall rules, DNS filtering, and logging

- **Virtual Machines in VMware**
  - Metasploitable2: vulnerable Linux target
  - Kali Linux: for penetration testing
  - Security Onion: IDS and NSM platform
  - Windows Server 2019: domain controller + file server

## ðŸ§° Software Stack

- **Monitoring & Security**
  - Splunk (SIEM)
  - Wazuh (Endpoint Detection)
  - Snort (IDS/IPS)
  - Security Onion (Network Security Monitoring)

- **Offensive Testing**
  - Nmap, Hydra, Burp Suite
  - Metasploit
  - Wireshark

- **Hardening Tools**
  - CIS Benchmarks
  - Group Policy on Windows Server
  - UFW/iptables for Linux

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Focus

- Demonstrate how to segment and secure a lab network
- Prepare the environment to simulate real-world attacks and defenses
- Document setup for hiring managers and certification auditors
