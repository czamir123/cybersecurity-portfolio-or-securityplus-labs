# Week 2: Vulnerability Scanning Lab (Documentation Only)

## 🎯 Goal
To simulate a real-world vulnerability assessment using tools like Nmap and OpenVAS or Nessus. You won’t run anything yet — this is the full written documentation.

## 🛠️ Tools We’re Writing About
- Nmap (port scanner)
- OpenVAS or Nessus (vulnerability scanner)
- Kali Linux (target machine)
- Linux VM (scanner machine)

## 🧠 What This Lab Teaches
- How to scan for open ports and services
- How to identify vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- How to generate and understand a scan report
- How to explain risk and security posture like a junior analyst

## 💼 What Employers See
This lab shows I understand basic vulnerability management and scanning workflows. Even before using the tools, I’m writing like someone who understands security processes and can explain what a scanner does.
