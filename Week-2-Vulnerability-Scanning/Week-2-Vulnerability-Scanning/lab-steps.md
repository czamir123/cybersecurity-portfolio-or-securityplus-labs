## ✅ Step 1: Set Up the Environment (On Paper)

You're documenting what the setup would look like. No tools are being used yet — this is to show you understand the environment.

- You would set up 2 virtual machines:
  - One **scanner** with Nmap + OpenVAS or Nessus
  - One **target** VM (example: Kali, Ubuntu, or Metasploitable2)
- Scanner can reach target via IP address (e.g., 192.168.56.101)

## ✅ Step 2: Nmap Scan (Document Only)

This is what you would type when scanning for open ports:

```bash
nmap -sV -p- -T4 192.168.56.101
