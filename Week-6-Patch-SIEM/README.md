# Week 6: Patch Management & SIEM Dashboards

This lab simulates a real-world IT environment. I patched Windows and Linux machines, used Nessus to validate, and visualized results in Splunk and Wazuh dashboards.

## Goals
- Automate patching on multiple OSes
- Prove patch success using Nessus
- Create SIEM dashboards to visualize patch compliance

## Tools Used
- VMware Server
- pfSense
- Windows/Linux VMs
- Wazuh or Splunk
- Nessus Essentials
- PowerShell, Bash

## Outcome
This proves I can manage patching and reporting across networks â€” a critical task in IT administration and cybersecurity.
