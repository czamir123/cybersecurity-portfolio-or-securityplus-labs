# Week 7: Forensics & Incident Response Lab

This lab simulates a real-world malware case. I analyzed a suspicious document, extracted metadata, found indicators of compromise (IOCs), and documented my full response like a pro.

## Goals
- Detect malicious files
- Extract IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Analyze metadata and embedded code
- Document incident steps and results

## Tools Used
- pdfid
- oledump
- ExifTool
- CyberChef
- Wireshark
- NetworkMiner

## Outcome
Created a simulated malware infection lab using VMware and pfSense, analyzed artifacts, and wrote an IR playbook. Screenshots and logs included.
