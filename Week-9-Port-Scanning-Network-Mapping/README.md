# Week 9: Port Scanning & Network Mapping

This lab simulates a real-world internal network assessment using open-source tools to identify vulnerable devices, map your environment, and harden your firewall.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Nmap (CLI + Zenmap GUI)
- pfSense Firewall
- VMware environment
- Wireshark (optional)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Perform TCP/UDP scans
- Create a network topology
- Identify insecure ports & misconfigured services
- Review firewall logs and adjust pfSense rules

## ðŸ“¸ Deliverables
- Nmap output files (.txt + .xml)
- Screenshots of Zenmap scans
- Screenshot of pfSense blocked ports
- Diagram of your test network (hand-drawn or software-generated)

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- How to discover open ports, running services, and exposed devices
- How to tune firewall rules to block unnecessary access
- Basics of asset discovery and mapping
